            Genetic engineering involves the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology,
             whereas gene editing refers to precise changes made to the DNA of a living organism.
              Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized this field, enabling scientists to edit genes with unprecedented accuracy.
               These advancements hold significant potential for medicine, agriculture, and environmental conservation, but also pose profound ethical questions.
               The foundation of genetic engineering was laid in the 1970s with the development of recombinant DNA technology. This allowed for the insertion of 
               foreign DNA into organisms, creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 in 2012 marked a major leap, allowing precise, targeted changes to the genome.
               Initial genetic modification experiments included transferring antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, demonstrating the possibility of gene transfer. The first genetically modified
                mouse was created in 1974, paving the way for mammalian genetic engineering.
