                The foundation of genetic engineering was laid in the 1970s with the development of recombinant DNA technology.
                This allowed for the insertion of foreign DNA into organisms, creating genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
                The discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 in 2012 marked a major leap, allowing precise, targeted changes to the genome.
                Respecting individuals' autonomy involves ensuring informed consent for genetic interventions.
                This is particularly complex in gene editing, where future generations could be affected by decisions made today.
                Gene therapies have shown success in treating conditions like spinal muscular atrophy and certain cancers.
                However, they raise ethical issues about the irreversible nature of genetic changes and the potential for unforeseen consequences.
                Projects like gene drives aim to spread genetic modifications rapidly through populations, potentially controlling diseases like malaria.
                Ethical concerns include the possibility of unintended ecological damage and the need for rigorous regulatory oversight.
